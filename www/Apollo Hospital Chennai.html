<p>Obesity is not a cosmetic issue, it’s a health issue.
</p>
<p>Obesity is described as the excessive accumulation of fat that exceeds the body's skeletal and physical standards. Taking into account the total number of afflicted individuals, obesity constitutes a significant disorder in the world.
</p>


<p>Obesity is measured by body mass index (BMI). BMI grades obesity into overweight (22.5-27.4), obese (27.5 – 32.4), super obese (32.5 – 37.4) &amp; morbid obesity (more than 37.5 or 40 kg over ideal weight). It becomes a serious health risk when it becomes morbid. Persons living with morbid obesity have 50 – 100% higher mortality rates than the one with a healthy weight, including more than 50% higher cancer mortality rate.The good news is that most obesity-related health problems improve, and some are even cured, after 70 – 80% of excess weight loss.
</p>


<p>According to international criteria, the indications for obesity surgery are BMI &gt;35 or BMI&gt;32.5 with pronounced co-morbidities. Nevertheless, limits to the indication for surgery continue to be changing.
