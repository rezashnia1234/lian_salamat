<p>Where is Singapore and the location of Singapore? Is Singapore part of China?<br />
<p>These are the two common thought when you mention about Singapore. They heard of Singapore but always have a wrong perception that it is located or part of China.</p>
</p>
<p>Singapore or Singapura is a city as well as a country in South East Asia, is a little red dot located just off the southern tip of Peninsular. Singapura is a Malay word. Singa means Lion and pura means City. That is why Singapore is also known as Lion City.</p>
<p>This Lion City was founded as a British Colony in 1918 and it had been developed into one of the world’s busiest port today. You may find lots of modern skyscrapers everywhere mixed together with a taste of traditional Chinese, Indian and Malay influences buildings. Combining with great taste food, fantastic shopping, exciting nightlife, first-class airport and connections to the rest of the world, this Lion City is a great stopover</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><h2>Brief History</h2></p>
<p>According to legend, Singapore was part of the Srivijayan Empire in the 13th century.</p>
<p>Began in 1819, Singapore was founded by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and he declare Singapore a free port, with no duties charged on trade. This policy had drawn traders from far and wide and turns her into one of the Asia’s busiest port.</p>
<p>When World War II broke out, Singapore was seen as a formidable British base; with several naval defenses guarding against assault by sea. However, to their surprise, the Japanese chose to cross Malaya by bicycle instead. Despite with all the effort to hold the Japanese, Singapore had surrendered on 1942 with less than a week of fighting. The Japan occupation lasted for three years and eight months with the return of the British in 1945. After the war, Singapore became a British Colony.</p>
<p>Singapore had joined Malaysia for a short time in 1963 when the British left, but Singapore left Malaysia and became independent on 9 August 1965. Since then, Singapore's economy boom for the subsequent forty years and become one of the four East Asian Tigers.</p>

<p><h2>People</h2></p>
<p>The people of Singapore are largely descendants of immigrants from the Malay Peninsula, China and the Indian sub-continent.</p>
<p>Singapore has a population of about 5 millions. Despite of its small size, Singapore is seen as a multi-racial country with the largest group is Chinese who made up of 75% of the population. The rest of the population of Singapore is made up of Malay (14%), Indians (9%) and Eurasians (2%).</p>
<p>Although the National language is Malay but English is atill used in Singapore as a language of administration. Most of the people in Singapore speak fluent English. At times, you will hear some Singlish too. Singlish is a mixture of English, Malay, Hokkien.</p>

<p><h2>Weather</h2></p>
<p>There are no different seasons in Singapore. The Singapore weather is usually sunny with the hottest period during from April to June and while most of the rainfalls take place during November to January. It will always be good to have the umbrella with you when come to Singapore. It will be useful for either sunny or rainy days.</p>
<p>There are many festival and events throughout the whole year. I will just name a few here.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for the Singapore Food Festival, held every year in July. The festival comprises of weekly core events, themed celebrations, culinary workshops and competitions organized across the whole Singapore</p>
<p>Look out for the Computer shows on every quarterly (March, June, September and December) throughout the whole year. Lots of computer and electronics goodies are up for grab during the show.</p>
<p>All shoppers take note, you can expect the Great Singapore Sales starting from May to July. Clothing, shoes, bags and many more are selling at a amazing discounted price. Remember to bring more extra lugguage for all you stuff when you come to Singapore.</p>
<p>Exciting event like Formula One night race is held in September. In 2008, Singapore had the privilege to host the first night-time event in Formula One history and it was staged on a street circuit, with the Singapore skyline as the backdrop.</p>

<p><h2>Food</h2></p>
<p>The people in Singapore loves to <em>makan</em> (eat in Malay). There are many hawker centers and 24-hour coffee shops offering cheap and a mix of Malay, Chinese, Indian and Western food. Restaurants who offer fine dinning can be found across the country too</p>

<p><h2>Economy</h2></p>
<p>Singapore had grows exponentially since independence and it has become one of the world's most prosperous countries with the world's busiest port.</p>

<p><h2>Geography</h2></p>
<p>Singapore is located at the southern tip of the Malayan Peninsula between Malaysia and Indonesia and has a total land area of 699 km². At present, Singapore has over 60 smaller islands around the main island.</p>
<p>Hope that you have gained much knowledge from this Introduction to Singapore.</p>
<p>Singapore has been described as a playground for the rich, and it's true that the small city-state does have a certain sheen of wealth. But Singapore offers more than just high-end shopping malls, luxury hotels, and fine dining (though it's worth indulging in those a bit if you can). There is also a vibrant history and diverse ethnic quarters to discover, along with many family-friendly attractions and lovely public spaces that make visiting this slightly futuristic city worthwhile.</p>
<p>Singapore has an excellent public transportation system that makes getting around convenient and easy. Once you've gotten a sense of the metro map, you'll have no problem zipping from one part of town to the next. English is spoken everywhere, and signs are in English as well. In fact, Singapore is one of the easiest and most comfortable countries to navigate in Southeast Asia. And as long as you're not comparing prices to nearby Thailand or Vietnam, you're in for a lovely stay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><h4>1. Marina Bay Sands</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (1).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>The opulent Marina Bay Sands resort complex includes a high-end luxury hotel, a mall with a canal running through it, the Art Science Museum, and the Marina Bay Sands Skypark - a vantage point for taking in the entire city. The Skypark's viewing deck and infinity pool are found in the ship (yes, ship) that tops the hotel. Only hotel guests are allowed to use the infinity pool, but anyone can visit the observation deck. From the Skypark, you can see the innovative double helix bridge, the port, the Gardens by the Bay, and the impressive skyline. While up there on top of the city, guests can grab a snack or a coffee at the rooftop restaurant or pick up some keepsakes from the souvenir stand. You can purchase a photo of yourself green-screened in front of the massive hotel as it's all lit up at night, but the cost is steep: 50 Singapore dollars. Better to ask a fellow tourist to snap a photo of you. The elegant opulence of the Marina Bay Sands exemplifies Singapore's style and status as a major international city in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p><h4>2. Gardens by the Bay</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (2).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
Once you've glimpsed this beautifully designed green space (from the top of the Marina Bay Sands, perhaps) you won't be able to stay away. Wander through the Bay East Garden, perfect for enjoying the vibrant plant life and escaping the city bustle for a moment. You won't want to miss Supertree Grove, where you'll find a cluster of the iconic, futuristic structures designed to perform environmentally sustainable functions. Then, head to the Cloud Forest Dome to see the world's tallest indoor waterfall and learn a bit about biodiversity. Check the website for final ticket sale and tour times.</p>

<p><h4>3. Botanic Gardens</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (3).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
Not to be confused with the Gardens on the Bay, the Botanic Gardens are also worth a visit. Singapore received its first UNESCO World Heritage nomination for the botanic gardens, and with good reason. The city can sometimes feel like a concrete jungle, albeit a clean and comfortable one, but the botanic gardens preserve pieces of Singapore's wilder heritage. Indeed, a walking trail leads to the gardens' heritage trees, which are conserved as part of an effort to protect the city's mature tree species. Make sure to see the impressive National Orchid Garden. Other popular things to do include visiting the eco-garden, eco-lake, bonsai garden, sculptures, and several other gardens and unique sites.</p>

<p><h4>4. Singapore Zoo</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (4).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
Billing itself as the world's best rainforest zoo, the Singapore Zoo is a pretty impressive place. The facility is clean and inviting, and the animals appear well treated, with plenty of lush vegetation and habitat space. The orangutans are particularly impressive, and visitors can watch as babies and adults alike swing high above their platforms and snack on bananas. There is also a large chimpanzee family, zebras, meerkats, a komodo dragon, mole rats, white tigers, kangaroos, and many other creatures.</p>
<p>Guests can observe feedings for some of the animals. Allow at least three hours to make your way around the zoo. If the zoo doesn't satisfy your need for getting close to wildlife, there's also the Night Safari, River Safari (including a giant panda forest), and the Jurong Bird Park. Park hopper passes are available if you plan to visit more than one of the wildlife parks.</p>
<p>For a unique and personal wildlife experience, try the Singapore Zoo Breakfast with the Orangutans. This hassle free tour includes transportation from and to your hotel, allows you a half day to explore the zoo, and has an optional upgrade to enjoy breakfast in the company of the zoo's much-loved orangutans.</p>

<p><h4>5. Orchard Road</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (5).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
One could be forgiven for coming to Singapore and doing nothing but shopping, as this is a world-class city for style and designer chic. The Orchard Road area is a great place to start a shopping spree, as there are high-end stores at every turn. You'd expect nothing less from a neighborhood that boasts 22 malls and six department stores. There are also four movie theaters, including an IMAX, and a KTV karaoke. If you get hungry while burning through all that cash, there are plenty of eateries in the neighborhood serving international cuisines.</p>

<p><h4>6. Singapore Flyer</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (6).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
If the observation deck at the Marina Bay Sands doesn't quite do it for you, try taking in high tea while looking out over the city from the Singapore Flyer, the world's largest giant observation wheel. Choose from several different packages that allow you to be served and pampered while enjoying a view that encompasses not only the Singapore skyline, but reaches to the Spice Islands of Indonesia and Malaysia's Straits of Johor. There are several different ticket packages to choose from, and each includes access to the multimedia Journey of Dreams exhibit, which delves into Singapore's history and the creation of the Singapore Flyer. Flights last 30 minutes each and run from early morning until late at night, so you can choose which view of the city you want to enjoy: the beginning of another bustling day or when Singapore is aglow after dark.</p>

<p><h4>7. Raffles Hotel Singapore</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (7).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
This colonial building is one of the world's last grand 19th-century hotels, once visited by literary luminaries such as Rudyard Kipling and Joseph Conrad, as well as movie star Charlie Chaplin. Built in 1887, the property has served as a city landmark for well over a century and continues to live up to its tony reputation with excellent food and service. The classical architecture and tropical gardens provide a refined setting and represent another facet of Singapore's varied and rich history.</p>
<p>The Raffles Hotel Singapore is located in the city's Colonial District, which is also home to several other historic sites, and a good place to base yourself in the city. Here, you'll find the Raffles Landing Site, where Sir Stamford Raffles is said to have stepped ashore in 1819. The story has it that he saw the small fishing village but recognized its potential as a port, so he purchased the land from the Sultan of Johor and invited Chinese and Indian immigrants to move here. And so the seeds of Singapore's multi-ethnic identity were sown.</p>

<p><h4>8. Chinatown</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (8).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
If you've ever visited China, Singapore's Chinatown neighborhood will bring you right back there. From the small mom-and-pop stores and authentic Chinese food to the bright red lanterns, there's an excitement and hustle in this district. You can visit the Chinese Heritage Centre and see the impressive and beautiful Sri Mariamman Hindu temple. Another temple worth seeing is the Buddha Tooth Relic temple. If you're up early enough (think 4am), you can hear the morning drum ceremony. Or you can just check out the closing ceremony in the evening after viewing the relic.</p>
<p>Heritage markers have been installed throughout the neighborhood in English, Japanese, and simplified Chinese, so visitors can better understand the significance of the area. But this neighborhood is not just a testament to the influence of the Chinese throughout Singapore's past. This is a progressive neighborhood (with free Wi-Fi for all), and it's home to the trendy Ann Siang Hill area, where the quaint bistros and upscale boutiques could be at home in any Western city.</p>

<p><h4>9. Sentosa Island</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (9).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>Singapore isn't exactly known as a beach destination, but if you're really craving some fun in the sun, Sentosa Island is the place to find it. Siloso Beach is a good spot for getting in beach time, and visitors can play volleyball on free courts or go kayaking and skimboarding. There are several other beach attractions as well, plus an Underwater World aquarium, where you can swim with dolphins. A must-see on Sentosa Island is the Merlion, Singapore's famous statue that has the head of a lion and the body of a fish. You can take an escalator to the top of the statue and enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding area. Fort Siloso, the country's only preserved fort, is also located on Sentosa Island. Adventurous types will want to check out The Flying Trapeze and the SeaBreeze Water-Sports @ Wave House, where you can try your hand at flying strapped to a water-propelled jet pack.</p>
</p>
<p><h4>10. Clarke Quay</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (10).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>The "center of commerce during the 19th century," Clarke Quay lives up to its legacy as a busy hub. Today, it has a more polished sheen, so after a long day of shopping on Orchard Road, visitors can happily head to Clarke Quay for an evening of waterfront dining and entertainment. River taxis and cruises also depart from here, giving tourists the chance to admire some of the city's historic bridges and view landmarks like the Merlion from the water. The Quay's biggest hit with younger tourists is a giant bungy-jumping attraction, an adrenaline-packed thrill ride. Nearby attractions include the Asian Civilisation Museum; the Civil Defence Heritage Gallery located in Singapore's oldest fire station; and the Hong San See Temple, a picturesque century-old Buddhist place of worship.</p>
</p>
<p><h4>11. Universal Studios Singapore</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (11).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>Universal Studios Singapore occupies 49 acres of Resorts World Sentosa. The park is arranged thematically, with each area paying tribute to a location, film, or television show. Destinations include New York City, Hollywood, Madagascar, and a trip back to Ancient Egypt. Fiction-themed areas include Shrek's Far Away, the Lost World, and Sci-Fi City where a pair of <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>-themed roller coasters dominate. In addition to the many rides that range from kiddie-friendly to daredevil, the park has diverse dining options, shopping, and live shows throughout the day and night.</p>
</p>
<p><h4>12. Night Safari Singapore</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (12).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>Night Safari Singapore puts a new twist on the traditional zoo experience by introducing visitors to the nocturnal lives of the residents. The park's habitats are divided into four sections, each with its own trail that lets you observe these elusive creatures as they go about their "day." The Leopard Trail has, as expected, leopards, as well as lions, flying foxes, civets, and porcupines among other animals. The Fishing Cat Trail tours the habitat of animals native to Singapore, including the fish-loving felines, pangolin, binturong, and other species both common and endangered. East Lodge Trail features Malayan tigers and spotted hyenas, and the Wallaby Trail introduces visitors to the marsupials of Australia. Private tours, buggy rides, and educational sessions are available, as well as once in a lifetime experiences, like an Asian elephant feeding session.</p>
</p>
<p><h4>13. Merlion Park</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (13).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>Singapore's Merlion is just what it sounds like - the figure of a mythical creature that has the head of a lion and the body and tail of a fish. The Merlion represents the city's humble start as a fishing village combined with its traditional Malay name Singapura - "lion city." The structure, which was relocated to Merlion Park in 2002, where it can overlook Marina Bay, weighs 70 tonnes and stands at 8.6 meters tall, spouting water from its mouth in a fountain. The "Merlion Cub" sits nearby, only two meters tall but a hefty three tonnes, and there are five additional official Merlion statues throughout the city. Merlion Park is an ideal spot for photo-ops, whether you are taking a selfie in front of the iconic creature or capturing the magnificent views from the park as it looks out over the bay.</p>
</p>
<p><h4>14. Asian Civilisations Museum</h4></p>
<p><img src="images/photos/tourismService/singapore/singapore (14).jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p>If the Raffles Hotel and Fort Canning Park haven't satisfied your taste for colonial architecture, pay a visit to the Empress Place Building. It was constructed in 1865 and built in the Neoclassical style, and was named in honor of Queen Victoria. It now houses the Asian Civilisations Museum, which delves into the many Asian cultures that helped form Singapore. The museum's collections focus on the themes of trade and spirituality, both of which heavily influenced Asian cultures and served as vehicles for the cultures to spread. Exhibits include topics like Indian Ocean trade, stories of faith and belief, and a look at the important role that scholars played in Chinese culture for centuries.</p>
