</p>
<p>According to the travel guide for Dubai, the best time to visit is between October and April because Dubai has only two seasons; hot and hotter. The months between October and April, known as the winter season, bring the blue skies and perfect beach weather to the city. It’s also the rainy season, but typically these showers don’t last too long, so don’t let this factor affect your travel dates.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><h2>Main Food in Dubai</h2></p>

Camel safaris, night camping, dune bashing, etc. are some of the popular things to do in Dubai for the newlyweds and couples on vacation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><h2>Nightlife in Dubai</h2></p>
<p>When it comes to partying after the sunset, Dubai can rival the top destinations in Europe. From pulsating nightclubs to rooftop parties at ocean-facing hotels, Dubai is the ultimate place to be after dark. Zero Gravity, Vault Bar, Skyview Bar, Buhayra Lounge, and Sensation Club are famous haunts to raise the roof.
</p>
<p>Dubai has become a must visit for on every tourists list, a hotspot for holidays because of its luxurious lifestyle, the glitz and the glamour. The city, indeed, has built a reputation as it has really transformed itself from a desert to a dazzling station for holidays and vacationing.
</p>
<p>The main thing to do is to look at the flights six months ahead because international airlines generally release their cheapest seats about six months prior to departure.

Plan Dubai tours from India with the help of our best-priced holiday packages listed below.
</p>
<p>If properly planned and executed Dubai Tourism will give you a glimpse of sunshine, the nomadic lifestyle, the luxurious lifestyle, and exuberant architecture at one place. The Dubai Mall is the live example of this contradiction. Do not forget to shop from some of the best outlets when in Dubai.
