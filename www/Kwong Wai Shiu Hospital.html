<p>Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital boasts 600 beds spread over a 12-storey nursing home building. Staffed by about 400 trained and professional employees, our In-patient Department (IPD), Rehabilitation Centre and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Centre serve thousands of patients every month.
</p>
<p>Despite being a charitable organisation that is heavily dependent on public support and donations, Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital remains focused on providing quality care and services to our clients.

<p><h2>History</h2>
</p>
<p>Founded in 1910 by a group of Cantonese merchants who wanted to provide poor immigrants with free medical services, Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital (KWSH) is one of Singapore’s oldest charitable healthcare institutions. Through the Kwong Wai Shiu Free Hospital Ordinance, a 6-acre piece of land with three colonial buildings (built in 1857) was parceled off from what was then Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and transferred to us by the British colonial government in 1911.
</p>
<p>In the last century, the Hospital has continued the strong tradition of community service, having cared for many generations of Singaporeans. To cope with Singapore’s changing healthcare needs, KWSH also underwent major redevelopments and has evolved into a community healthcare hub today. Given the historical significance of KWSH’s premises, the Urban Redevelopment Authority has awarded conservation status to four of the Hospital’s buildings. These buildings include KWSH’s Main Building and three former Tan Tock Seng Hospital wards.
</p>
<p>In 2018, KWSH set up our Heritage Gallery and Trail with the objective of inspiring future generations to uphold the philanthropic spirit of our forefathers. To find out more about KWSH’s Heritage Gallery and Trail, visit heritage.kwsh.org.sg.
